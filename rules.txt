The game is played between two players: the machine and the user.
On each play, the computer chooses its element first
and then he asks you to choose it.
If both elements are the same, then a tie occurs.
If not, whoever wins is established by these rules:
- Scissors cut the paper
- Paper envelops the stone
- The stone crushes the lizard
- The lizard poisons Spock
- Spock breaks the scissors
- Scissors decapitate the lizard
- The lizard devours the paper
- The paper unauthorizes Spock
- Spock vaporizes the stone
- Stone crushes scissors
